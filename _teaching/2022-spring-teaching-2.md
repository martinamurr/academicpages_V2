As part of the Physics internship for Medical-Technical Assistants Laboratory (MTA-L), I delivered theoretical lectures and supervised students during practical sessions. Topics included fundamental concepts of electrical engineering, mechanics with a focus on the inclined plane, and mechanical oscillations demonstrated through the pendulum. The course emphasized hands-on application of physics principles in a medical-physics context.
