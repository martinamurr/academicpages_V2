excerpt: 'Deformable dose accumulation for online-adaptive magnetic resonance guided radiotherapy (OA-MRgRT) and non-adaptive, conventional image-guided radiation therapy of prostate cancer were compared.
Significant differences in accumulated overall doses were found for organs at risk.
Clinical target volume coverage was similar in all approaches.
However, estimated clinical effects were small for 20 x 3 Gy treatments.
The developed method and workflow feasible and can be transferred to various scenarios.'

Conventional image-guided radiotherapy (conv-IGRT) is standard in prostate cancer (PC) but does not account for inter-fraction anatomical changes. Online-adaptive magnetic resonance-guided RT (OA-MRgRT) may improve organ-at-risk (OARs) sparing and clinical target volume (CTV) coverage. The aim of this study was to analyze accumulated OAR and target doses in PC after OA-MRgRT and conv-IGRT in comparison to pre-treatment reference planning (refPlan).
Ten patients with PC, previously treated with OA-MRgRT at the 1.5 T MR-Linac (20x3Gy), were included. Accumulated OA-MRgRT doses were determined by deformably registering all fraction’s MR-images. Conv-IGRT was simulated through rigid registration of the planning computed tomography with each fraction’s MR-image for dose mapping/accumulation. Dose-volume parameters (DVPs), including CTV D50% and D98%, rectum, bladder, urethra, Dmax and V56Gy for OA-MRgRT, conv-IGRT and refPlan were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Clinical relevance of accumulated dose differences was analyzed using a normal-tissue complication-probability model.
CTV-DVPs were comparable, whereas OA-MRgRT yielded decreased median OAR-DVPs compared to conv-IGRT, except for bladder V56Gy. OA-MRgRT demonstrated significantly lower median rectum Dmax over conv-IGRT (59.1/59.9 Gy, p = 0.006) and refPlan (60.1 Gy, p = 0.012). Similarly, OA-MRgRT yielded reduced median bladder Dmax compared to conv-IGRT (60.0/60.4 Gy, p = 0.006), and refPlan (61.2 Gy, p = 0.002). Overall, accumulated dose differences were small and did not translate into clinically relevant effects.
Deformably accumulated OA-MRgRT using 20x3Gy in PC showed significant but small dosimetric differences comparted to conv-IGRT. Feasibility of a dose accumulation methodology was demonstrated, which may be relevant for evaluating future hypo-fractionated OA-MRgRT approaches.
