SUMMARY 
======
My career in medical technology began with an apprenticeship as an industrial electronics technician, which I successfully completed in 2004. I remained with the same company until 2020, where I held various positions, including commissioning, technical authorship, service engineering, and most recently, project management. My professional journey has consistently connected me to the fields of medical technology and physics, encompassing areas such as mammography, radiotherapy, and computed tomography. Driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I pursued further education alongside my career. I successfully completed my first distance learning degree in electrical engineering (FH) in 2013. Subsequently, in 2020, I earned a master’s degree in medical physics, which deepened my understanding of “medical imaging and processing” and “radiation physics,” among other subjects.

“I have no special talent, I am just passionately curious.” (Albert Einstein)

This passion for learning ultimately led me to fully focus on scientific work. In 2025, I successfully completed my PhD in the field of magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT), concentrating on the determination of the total delivered treatment dose. Through this work, I acquired in-depth knowledge of clinical workflows, dose management in radiation oncology and knowledge transfer.

“The more you know, the more you realize what you do not yet know.” (Socrates)

My career trajectory is defined by technical expertise, scientific curiosity, and a strong commitment to advancing the fields of medical technology and physics. I am keen to apply and further enhance my research skills in a postdoctoral role, particularly by addressing complex scientific questions and contributing to innovative, patient-relevant solutions. I greatly value interdisciplinary collaboration and the exchange of ideas across professional boundaries. To me, research is more than merely generating results—it represents an opportunity to challenge assumptions, drive innovation, and promote meaningful progress in both scientific and clinical contexts. With a diverse background encompassing industry, research, and teaching, I believe I am well positioned to contribute to scientific advancement, clinical improvement, and the transfer of academic knowledge. 

PERSONAL PROFILE
======
I possess extensive expertise in medical technology and physics, especially in mammography, radiotherapy, computed tomography, and MR-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT), with a strong focus on radiation dose determination and MR physics. My professional experience includes hands-on work in electrical engineering, system commissioning, technical documentation, and project management. Throughout my career, I have independently led scientific projects and contributed to interdisciplinary research environments. Scientific challenges motivate me, and I approach my work with precision, responsibility, and a goal-oriented mindset. I place great importance on clarity in scientific communication and the practical relevance of research outcomes. Flexibility and creativity enable me to adapt quickly to new topics and work effectively—both autonomously and within teams. My ambition is to contribute meaningfully to the development of adaptive, image-based therapies and to support the integration of research, clinical application, and education in a forward-thinking environment.
