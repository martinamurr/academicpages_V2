Online MR-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) enables optimal plan adaptation with respect to the patientâ€™s daily anatomy and thus allowing maximum target coverage and organ at risk (OAR) sparing. To date methods for deformable dose accumulation (DDA) are lacking, which would be a major prerequisite for the development of accurate dose-response models and precise clinical dose constraints. The aim of this study was to develop and implement different strategies of DDA and compare them to a fraction-based dose summation (DS).
